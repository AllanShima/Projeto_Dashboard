Semester's final project. It involves the development of a dashboard for better visualization of the data gathered.
The data, in "csv" format, was extracted from the following gov website: "https://www.infosiga.sp.gov.br/mapas/"
Our main objective was to point out the main areas of risk inside of the city perimeters of "SP-Mar√≠lia", showing more detail on the board.
